Basically, i was wondering if there was a Mr Incredible Uncanny 2048, so i decided so search for it on the web and found nothing. So i decided to make my own, which was forked from cdivry's 2048 with images https://github.com/cdivry/2048-with-IMAGES 

The original 2048 was made by Gabriele Cirulli https://github.com/gabrielecirulli and can be played here https://play2048.co/
